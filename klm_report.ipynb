    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this study, we predict the completions times for four tasks using the KLM method and verify them by experiments. \n",
    "For the prediction we use on the one hand the times defined by Card, Moran and Newell (1980) but on the other hand also the times determined by ourselves in an earlier experiment. "

    "## Test design\n",
    "For this study, a previously programmed calculator was used to log all relevant inputs with timestamps to obtain the task completion time. Participants are presented with the pocket calculator in their normal work environment on their home computers. One after the other, four predefined tasks are presented concerning the use of the calculator. To get a range of times each experiment is repeated for 10 times. \n",
    "After each task, the associated csv file is saved separately for later analysis."
